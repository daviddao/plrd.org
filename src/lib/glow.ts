/**
 * Read-only weekly solar metrics for the FA2 Live Dashboard, sourced the same
 * way glow.org/archives reads them today: per-week static snapshots published
 * to Glow's public R2 bucket.
 *
 *   GET {GLOW_R2_BASE}/week-{n}/filtered-data.json
 *     → [{ powerOutput, carbonCreditsProduced, hexlifiedPublicKey, ... }, ...]
 *
 * Each element is one audited farm; `powerOutput` is its kWh for the week and
 * `carbonCreditsProduced` its metric tons CO₂. We sum those across farms to get
 * the per-week totals glow.org renders, then build a rolling weekly activity
 * series (last `TREND_WEEKS` audited weeks) for the trend charts.
 *
 * History: this module used to POST to the `headline_farm_stats` aggregator
 * against a hardcoded GCA server (http://95.217.194.59:35015). That GCA server
 * was retired — the aggregator still answers but returns zero farms — so the
 * dashboard silently degraded to 0. glow.org itself moved to the R2 snapshots
 * below, which is now the canonical public source.
 *
 * The snapshot files are large (~5 MB/week) because each farm carries 2016
 * per-slot sample arrays we don't need, so we sum the two scalar fields with a
 * targeted regex instead of JSON.parse-ing the whole graph. A flaky/empty
 * upstream yields 0 + `degraded: true` rather than failing the page (same
 * contract as `fetchGainforestStats`).
